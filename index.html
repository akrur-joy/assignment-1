                        <p>By learning to code, I'm providing myself with the
                            resources I need to make a significant impact on the

                            and create tools that improve people's lives.
                            Numerous academic fields, including healthcare,
                            education, and environmental sustainability, can
                            benefit from my work. With every single line of
                            code, I have the ability to further progress,
                            inspire change, and build a better future for all.
                            My passion is coding, and I'll change the world.

                        <br>
                        <p>I find inspiration for my web designs in many places.
                            I often look to other designers and web developers
                            for inspiration and ideas. I also like to look at
                            the latest trends in web design, such as responsive
                            design, minimalism, and user-centered design.
                            Additionally, I often draw inspiration from the
                            content and goals of the website I am designing, as
                            well as the target audience. Finally, I also try to
                            draw inspiration from my own creativity and
                            experience to come up with unique and innovative
                            designs.
